<div>
<p class = "para">As soon as the page is loaded, it is opened to the index page, which i’ve labeled the about me page, greeted by a background image of multiple shades of blue, and white. The font chosen is called orbitron, sans-serif, colored dark grey to assist in readability with the chosen background, the text is relatively large and is enclosed within boxes that are shaded in with a transparent purple colour which helps with readability further, there is also a (213x379) profile picture of myself. Features such as the background, the colours of boxes, text font and colour, menu, and the way references are opened when clicked are consistent on all pages.</p>

<p class = "para">upon clicking the button to the unit 1 page you see the “cyber city” image, alongside all other consistent features, upon clicking the button to the unit 2 and contact me page you will be met with the same features except the images</p>

        Constraints in website design are as follows:
        
        Page size - This is due to the variation of hardware devices that we use, for example, mobile phones, laptops, PC, etc. because of this there is a huge variation on the amount of information that can be displayed at one time, this is because monitor size directly affects the width of websites, as the typical convention is that website should only expand and contract lengthwise, as a consequence this is seen in the browser windows of users who use significantly larger monitors, as many elements within a website are centred, which gives rise to unused space on either side of the screen

 </p>
</div>
 <br>
 <br>
 <div>
<p class = "para">Browser - because different browsers render the code of HTML and CSS differently there is an issue of making your website “cross browser compatible”, making your website look consistent or as similar as possible between different browsers, e.g. safari, google chrome, and firefox, in most cases the least technologically advanced browser dictates the capabilities of your website, some of which have fundamental errors in the ways it renders CSS</p>

<p class = "para">Copyright is a law that pertains to the property rights of the individual, it is the exclusive, assignable legal right given to the originator for a fixed number of years, in short the creator of a particular piece of work holds the right to say how others may use that work, however in the case of a website, there is no copyright as is the case with typical works intellectual property, such as books, songs, films etc. However it will protect some or all elements within a website, under the copyright, designs and patents act 1988, by which enumerated classes of work are stated to be eligible for protection.
Some of these classes include:
</p>
</div>
<br>
<br>
<div>
<p class = "para">Text - If completely original, and proven to be a product of the authors skill, labour and effort, as well as not being copied from any other source, text within a website is protected as a literary work or a collection of literary works, this extends not only to text, but to any other type of recorded symbolic code regardless of literary merit.
</p>
</div>
<br>
<br>
<div>
<p class = "para">HTML - As it incorporates the website text which is protected if the conditions of text within a website are met, however the extension here will be seen in the websites meta-information, headings, paragraphs, image sources, positions, text characteristics, page divisions and others, however again for this condition to be met for protection, requisite originality must be proven.
</p>
</div>
<br>
<br>
<div>
<p class = "para">CSS - an acronym for Cascading Style Sheets, which is responsible for the appearance of a webpage, applied to markup by web browsers in the process of rendering a web page, influencing elements such as positioning and spacing, colours of page elements, font type and size as well as style again for this condition to be met for protection, requisite originality must be proven.
</p>
</div>
<br>
<div>
<p class = "para">Software code - similar to HTML, it is protected as a literary work

According to section 21 of the disability and discrimination act, any website must now make reasonable adjjustments to ensure such people as the partially sighted or deaf have access to your services and content, further enforced by the equality act 2010.

<p class = "para">Colour blindness - this affects approximately 5-8% of males worldwide (around 10 million), and less than 1% of females, designing for color blindness is because it is hard to determine what color blind users see and how that is different from what the average user sees.
And the difference between the different types of color blindness just adds an additional layer of complexity.

There are many file types used within websites, some of which are common use whilst others are more specialised. <br>

EXE - this  is an executable file, and comes up when downloading and installing programs onto a device<br>


GIF - Graphics Interchange Format, which is the most common image format on the internet currently, <br>



JPG/JPEG - Joint Photographic Experts Group File, which is another common image file type used on the internet, mainly used for photographs<br>

In my opinion all pages on my website are error free, and the content shown on my website is appropriate, as the purpose of my website is a blog, accounting my journey in the creation of the site, including a critical evaluation of the IT tools I've chosen to use, as well as how these tools have helped me progress with time and task management, current constraints on web development, and other topics. After subjecting my site to various “fresh eyes” for reviews and criticism, i’ve had mixed reviews about the same elements within my website, the first criticism came against the background I had chosen, the most memorable was “there is simply too much going on for me to focus on the text”, on the topic of the text, another criticism came from my choice of text font as well as the text colour, i thought to remedy this by placing the text within black boxes to improve readability. As far as navigability is concerned, i have created a menu at the top of each page, this is so that navigation between pages was as seamless as possible, also when references are clicked, instead of taking the user off of the entire site, it opens up the source in a new tab so that the user can easily go back to where they finished reading. Finally when the user scrolls down more than 20 pixels a button to take the user back to the top appears, to make it convenient for the user to get back to the menu bar. 
In conclusion I believe the website is fit for purpose
