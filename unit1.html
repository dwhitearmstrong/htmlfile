    <p class = "para">1.1 <br> The world is now entered an age of rapid technological progression, where by it is more important than ever to have individuals who are technologically literate, for example in the collection of, and interpretation of data, as well as the defence of that data from those who might abuse their skills for profit or ideological reasons, the creation of tools large and small businesses can use to expand their client/customer base in order to increase profit, it is especially important if a business has adopted a bezosian style business model, in which the technology itself is sold for cheap, however profit is made by the customers use of the technology and use of its in app services, micro transactions, and other convenient UI and UX experiences, it therefore follows that IT in modern business is more important than ever, especially in the case of maintaining, securing and updating these systems.

    <p class = "para">1.2<br> The tools and skills required to make a digital project successful are numerous, the skills required would be, firstly, a methodical approach to organising workload, which can be achieved by using an application tool called trello, which utilises a “kanban” approach to project management, in which large projects are broken down systematically into small manageable tasks in the form of “cards”, it is especially useful in group projects.
    Another skill would be communication, the ability to communicate your point or what you're doing or intend to be doing in a clear, concise and non-superfluous way so that anyone from a layman to a work colleague/team member can respond appropriately, this is key, for example, in presentations, stand ups, and teaching other colleagues what you've learned, a tool I've used for this would be slack, which serves to be an excellent communication hub between myself and teammates, supervisors, etc.
    </p>
    <p class = "para"> 1.3 <br>planning and carrying out projects is in and of itself a daunting behemoth of a task, however I find it more appropriate to conceptualise the whole project as an end product, then incrementally break down that end product, then figure out how to make that particular part function, this then becomes a task to do, this works appropriately with the Kanban method mentioned earlier on the trello application

        Risks to projects come in various forms, internally, for example on the part of the individual or acting as a team, a lack of research and tackling the project holistically rather than reductively will lead to failure at worst and stultification alongside wasted time at best, this is because jumping straight into a project without addressing the questions <br>“what is it i am trying to achieve and how will this be achieved?” <br> which aids in methodically walking through what needs to be done, and with it you could note any prospective problems that may arise. 
    A consistent lack of communication or inefficient communication could also lead to project failure, for example:</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <ul>
    <li>Asking bad questions that do not have enough information</li> 
    <li>Misleading questions</li> 
    <li>X-Y problems</li> 
    <li>Questions you could have searched for yourself using a search engine like google when asking for help</li> 
    <br> 
    <p class = "para">And broad questions. Before you take away an individuals attention away from a given task, its good to think to yourself before you ask,</p>
    <li>What does the whole program do?</li>
    <li>If something does not work within this program</li>
    <li>What is it, & what is it meant to be doing?</li>
    <li>How is it not working? Did you expect a specific response or result?</li>
    <li>If you’re calling a function, where and how is it being called?</li>
    <li>What language are you writing in?</li>
    <p class = "para">And other such questions to help speed up the process, formulate a question first, the more specific you are the greater the quality of help you can recieve and the faster you can get back to your task. 
    Human error could be another factor in causing project failure for example, if an individual does not follow prescribed or recommended cyber security protocols, it could lead to theft interference or total deletion of project data, or other harmful prospective outcomes.</p>

    The process of choosing IT systems and software, it would be more appropriate to be pragmatic and use the best that you have available to you for that particular task, in this case I chose to work with a Macbook pro, this is due to the fact that I have grown familiar to it’s operating system, as well as that, there are certain software that can only be accessed by using its native system, for example Xcode, for creating native apple applications and cross platform applications. I also thought it would be best to find a tool or application to help me organise my project into small and manageable tasks, as well as helping me keep track of what has actually been completed, what currently needs doing, and what’s being done at this moment in time, in this area I decided on using trello. </p>
<p class = "para"> 1.6<br> 
    my previous group project required a software called Xcode, an IDE specifically designed to create applications for apple devices which only seems to work on these particular devices, Xcode allows for the creation of both cross platform applications, and native swift based applications for IOS, it also has an easier way of creating these native applications through “storyboards” and various controllers, and finally a simulator to see how the prospective app is progressing and how the end product looks on various apple devices, such as the Iphone X and its predecessors, another tool ive been using has been github, a repository service which provides a web based graphical interface, access control features and various collaboration features as well as basic task management tools, however its main use for myself has been its use as a repository, which allows me to upload and store the projects i've currently been working on, with each save updating the repository, which prevents data loss, and which allows for example, a secure way for me to show my teammates my progress on a particular project, etc

    GDPR is an acronym for General Data Protection Regulation, created by the EU to protect the personal data of anyone considered to be a data subject, (a natural person), and to also keep up to date with the rapid global technological advances, its aim is to adjust the legal regulations regarding the processing and protection of personal data, including identifiers such as a name, identification number, location, or other such factors that specific to physical, physiological, genetic, mental/cognitive, economic, cultural and societal identities, which in current times, there is unprecedented access to and unscrutinized use of personal data by all types of businesses, one of its end goals is to allow data subjects (individuals that use any online service), a significant degree of control over the processing of their data, giving independent public authorities flexible supervisory powers and rights to punish any non compliance via fine or economic sanction.</p>
<p class = "para">In short, it regulates how companies or businesses store data, and so data flows must be designed with this regulation in mind, therefore must only collect data relevant for their current means, a data minimisation principle, instead of the common method of data retention of collecting and storing great swathes of data because it may be useful to use later.</p>
<p class = "para">Non compliance with these regulations will incur huge, economically crippling punishments, which will also harm a company's image, not only that, but in cases of Information Technology centred companies, that reside within its member states or outside of the EU, it is required that they submit to an independent authority, such as a data controller or processor who may be forced to take specific actions to remain compliant to the regulation within specific timelines that can usually conflict with business interests, such as temporary limiting on data processing or its outright banning, since its enforcement all companies wishing to do business within the EU/EEA have had to audit personal data flows and define a legal basis for their collection and retention, creating further obligations and expenses on the part of the company.</p>

<p class = "para">2.1, 2.2, 3.1, 3.2 <br>
    In the creation of my website I have used a good range of tools, such as Visual Studio code, trello, google fonts, etc, in this section I will state the advantages and disadvantages of each and conclude in their usefulness in regards to my approach to website creation.</p>
</div>
<br>
<div>
<p class = "para">Visual studio code - visual studio code is a cross platform source code editor mainly used for front end development, used to edit, view, run and debug the source code for applications, its advantages include its “intellisense” feature which is extremely helpful with individual productivity, including a code editing feature for code completion, parameter information, quick information, content assisting and code hinting, on all these features work in synchronicity to help the user complete new projects as quickly as their own individual skills can allow, continuously pointing out errors before debugging.</p>
</div>
<br>
<div>
<p class = "para">Another advantage would be its built in version control via github, when connected to github visual studio code makes it remarkably easy to see which files have been modified, unsaved and unpushed. Through the use of the inbuilt terminal, we can initialise git and perform various git commands, such as push, pull, rebase, publish, etc.</p>
</div>
<br> 
<div>  
<p class = "para">Another advantage would be its debugging feature and support, which help accelerate editing, compiling and other such things.</p>
</div>
<br>
<div>
<p class = "para">Trello - trello is a cross platform web application, which allows the user to send and receive files from their team, understand instantly when deadlines loom, through the use of cards, that can have due dates added to them, as the date nears the cards in question will change colour from white to yellow, and when the due date has passed it will change again to the colour red, but this can be avoided by marking the due date as complete. This in immensely helpful in regards to my own productivity, this is because, using this particular system pushes me to stay focused on one task at a time until it is, with certainty, completed.</p>
</div>
<br>
<div>        
<p class = "para">The guiding principle behind trello is reductionism, to organise large projects by breaking them down into smaller easier to manage components, for example “create website” becomes “formulate text content for each web page”, “use html to print text content onto X number of pages” ,“use html to create links to relevant pages to improve UX by improving website navigability”,etc, this system is known as kanban.</p>
</div>
<br> 
<div>    
<p class = "para">However on the flipside it can be difficult to handle huge projects with this system, especially when there are multiple teams involved, spread across various physical locations, it makes organisation and standardisation a superfluous and frustrating process, there is also a problem with storage limits, with each card limited to the storage of 10mb for each upload for basic member, which increases for business and gold users at 250 mb.</p>
</div>
<br>   
<div> 
<p class = "para">However for our purposes, in the context of a small project, these tools work remarkably well together, utilising these applications, trello to manage time and task management, as well as the sharing of information, and visual studio with its various features as mentioned above which make the creation of projects as simple as possible help me conclude that the choice of these IT tools were appropriate for my project.</p>
</div>
<br> 
<div>
<p class = "para">If this was a team project, it would probably be better to delegate roles, such as one person is responsible for dealing with the content of the website, another would print the content within the html, and another person would deal with how the website should look, as well as researching if such a design is pragmatic with our current skill level, and another person would be responsible for the CSS aspect of the site once the HTML is done. This would have improved productivity, however it would be at the cost of efficiency, as output would be significantly slower.</p>
</div> 
<br>   
<div>
<p class = "para">This could be combated by, for example, time management, tracking and limiting how much time is spent on each task, taking regular breaks, attending and holding stand up meetings only when necessary, forsaking multi tasking, and other similar work optimisations.</p>
</div>
<br>
<div>
<p class = "para">2.3 & 2.4<br>
    At my current skill level I am satisfied with how my website has turned out, in particular i am happy with my choice of font,the way my references, when clicked don’t push the user out of the site completely, but opens a new tab, which allows the user to inspect my sources as well as pick up where they left off in reading, as well as its colour, this is because for the most part it is very easy to read, however there are sections of text that, when in contact with bright patches of the background, become slightly difficult to read, this is mostly overcome by the use of dividers within the html code, as well as the creation of boxes surrounding the text, which I have used RGBA to create a purple colour to assist with readability, given enough time to improve my skills, I would have liked to include a more interactive menu, and a slightly more elegant user interface that would have reduced the number of pages required to create this site as it is now. However I thought it would be more appropriate to keep to a more basic UI, and gradually update as time goes on and my skills improve.</p>
