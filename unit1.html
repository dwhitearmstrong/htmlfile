    <p>The world is now entered an age of rapid technological progression, where by it is more important than ever to have individuals who are technologically literate, for example in the collection of, and interpretation of data, as well as the defence of that data from those who might abuse their skills for profit or ideological reasons, the creation of tools large and small businesses can use to expand their client/customer base in order to increase profit, it is especially important if a business has adopted a bezosian style business model, in which the technology itself is sold for cheap, however profit is made by the customers use of the technology and use of its in app services, micro transactions, and other convenient UI and UX experiences, it therefore follows that IT in modern business is more important than ever, especially in the case of maintaining, securing and updating these systems.

    <p> The tools and skills required to make a digital project successful are numerous, the skills required would be, firstly, a methodical approach to organising workload, which can be achieved by using an application tool called trello, which utilises a “kanban” approach to project management, in which large projects are broken down systematically into small manageable tasks in the form of “cards”, it is especially useful in group projects.
    Another skill would be communication, the ability to communicate your point or what you're doing or intend to be doing in a clear, concise and non-superfluous way so that anyone from a layman to a work colleague/team member can respond appropriately, this is key, for example, in presentations, stand ups, and teaching other colleagues what you've learned, a tool I've used for this would be slack, which serves to be an excellent communication hub between myself and teammates, supervisors, etc.
    </p>
    <p> planning and carrying out projects is in and of itself a daunting behemoth of a task, however I find it more appropriate to conceptualise the whole project as an end product, then incrementally break down that end product, then figure out how to make that particular part function, this then becomes a task to do, this works appropriately with the Kanban method mentioned earlier on the trello application

    <p>Risks to projects come in various forms, internally, for example on the part of the individual or acting as a team, a lack of research and tackling the project holistically rather than reductively will lead to failure at worst and stultification alongside wasted time at best, this is because jumping straight into a project without addressing the questions <li>“what is it i am trying to achieve and how will this be achieved?”</li> <br> which aids in methodically walking through what needs to be done, and with it you could note any prospective problems that may arise. 
    A consistent lack of communication or inefficient communication could also lead to project failure, for example:
    <ul><li>Asking bad questions that do not have enough information</li> 
    <li>Misleading questions</li> 
    <li>X-Y problems</li> 
    <li>Questions you could have searched for yourself using a search engine like google when asking for help</li> 
    <br> And broad questions. Before you take away an individuals attention away from a given task, its good to think to yourself before you ask,
    <li>What does the whole program do?</li>
    <li>If something does not work within this program</li>
    <li>What is it, & what is it meant to be doing?</li>
    <li>How is it not working? Did you expect a specific response or result?</li>
    <li>If you’re calling a function, where and how is it being called?</li>
    <li>What language are you writing in?</li>
    And other such questions to help speed up the process, formulate a question first, the more specific you are the greater the quality of help you can recieve and the faster you can get back to your task. 
    Human error could be another factor in causing project failure for example, if an individual does not follow prescribed or recommended cyber security protocols, it could lead to theft interference or total deletion of project data, or other harmful prospective outcomes.

<p>The process of choosing IT systems and software, it would be more appropriate to be pragmatic and use the best that you have available to you for that particular task, in this case I chose to work with a Macbook pro, this is due to the fact that I have grown familiar to it’s operating system, as well as that, there are certain software that can only be accessed by using its native system, for example Xcode, for creating native apple applications and cross platform applications. I also thought it would be best to find a tool or application to help me organise my project into small and manageable tasks, as well as helping me keep track of what has actually been completed, what currently needs doing, and what’s being done at this moment in time, in this area I decided on using trello. </p>
<p> my previous group project required a software called Xcode, an IDE specifically designed to create applications for apple devices which only seems to work on these particular devices, Xcode allows for the creation of both cross platform applications, and native swift based applications for IOS, it also has an easier way of creating these native applications through “storyboards” and various controllers, and finally a simulator to see how the prospective app is progressing and how the end product looks on various apple devices, such as the Iphone X and its predecessors, another tool ive been using has been github, a repository service which provides a web based graphical interface, access control features and various collaboration features as well as basic task management tools, however its main use for myself has been its use as a repository, which allows me to upload and store the projects i've currently been working on, with each save updating the repository, which prevents data loss, and which allows for example, a secure way for me to show my teammates my progress on a particular project, etc

<p>GDPR is an acronym for General Data Protection Regulation, created by the EU to protect the personal data of anyone considered to be a data subject, (a natural person), and to also keep up to date with the rapid global technological advances, its aim is to adjust the legal regulations regarding the processing and protection of personal data, including identifiers such as a name, identification number, location, or other such factors that specific to physical, physiological, genetic, mental/cognitive, economic, cultural and societal identities, which in current times, there is unprecedented access to and unscrutinized use of personal data by all types of businesses, one of its end goals is to allow data subjects (individuals that use any online service), a significant degree of control over the processing of their data, giving independent public authorities flexible supervisory powers and rights to punish any non compliance via fine or economic sanction.
    In short, it regulates how companies or businesses store data, and so data flows must be designed with this regulation in mind, therefore must only collect data relevant for their current means, a data minimisation principle, instead of the common method of data retention of collecting and storing great swathes of data because it may be useful to use later.
    Non compliance with these regulations will incur huge, economically crippling punishments, which will also harm a company's image, not only that, but in cases of Information Technology centred companies, that reside within its member states or outside of the EU, it is required that they submit to an independent authority, such as a data controller or processor who may be forced to take specific actions to remain compliant to the regulation within specific timelines that can usually conflict with business interests, such as temporary limiting on data processing or its outright banning, since its enforcement all companies wishing to do business within the EU/EEA have had to audit personal data flows and define a legal basis for their collection and retention, creating further obligations and expenses on the part of the company.
